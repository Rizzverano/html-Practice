        <pre>
            The road I have traveled on
            Is paved with good intentions
            It's littered with broken dreams
            That never quite came true
            When all of my hopes were dying
            Her love kept me trying
            She does her best to hide
            The pain that she's been through

            When she cries (she cries) at night (at night)
            And she doesn't think that I can hear her
            She tries (she tries) to hide (to hide)
            All the fears she feels inside
            So I pray (I pray) this time (this time)
            I can be the man that she deserves
            'Cause I die a little each time
            When she cries

            She's always been there for me
            Whenever I've fallen
            When nobody else believes
            She'll be there by my side
            I don't know how she takes it
            Just once I'd like to make it
            Then there'll be tears of joy
            That fill her loving eyes

            When she cries (she cries) at night (at night)
            And she doesn't think that I can hear her
            She tries (she tries) to hide (to hide)
            All the fears she feels inside
            So I pray (I pray) this time (this time)
            I can be the man that she deserves
            'Cause I die a little each time
            When she cries

            So I pray this time (this time)
            I can be the man that she deserves
            'Cause I die a little each time
            When she cries
